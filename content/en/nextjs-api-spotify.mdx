I wanted to show the song I'm currently listening to on my site, along with my favorite songs. To do this, I needed to integrate the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) with [Next.js API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction). This post will be a quick tutorial to get started with Spotify.

## Create an Application

First, we need to create an application on Spotify to obtain credentials that will allow us to authenticate with the API.

- Go to your [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) and log in.
- Click on **Create an App**.
- Fill in the name and description and click **create**.
- Click on **Show Client Secret**.
- Save your Client ID and Secret. You will need them shortly.
- Click on **Edit Settings**.
- Add `http://localhost:3000` as a redirect URI.

All set! Now you have a properly configured Spotify application and the correct credentials to make requests.

## Authentication

There are several ways to authenticate with the Spotify API, depending on your application. Since we need permission granted _only once_, we will use the [Authorization Code Flow](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/#authorization-code-flow).

First, our application will request authorization by logging in with the necessary [permissions](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/#list-of-scopes). Here's an example of how the URL might look. Replace `client_id` and permissions with your own values.

```sh
https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id=8e94bde7ddb84a1f7a0e51bf3bc95be8&response_type=code&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost:3000&scope=user-read-currently-playing%20user-top-read
```

After authorizing, you will be redirected back to your `redirect_uri`. In the URL, there will be a `code` query parameter. Save this value.

```sh
http://localhost:3000/callback?code=NApCCg..BkWtQ
```

Next, we will need to retrieve the refresh token. You will need to generate a Base64 encoded string containing the client ID and secret that you obtained earlier. You can use [this tool](https://www.base64encode.org/) to encode online. The format should be `client_id:client_secret`.

```sh
curl -H "Authorization: Basic <base64 encoded client_id:client_secret>" -d grant_type=authorization_code -d code=<code> -d redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost:3000 https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token
```

This will return a JSON response containing a `refresh_token`. This token is [valid indefinitely](https://github.com/spotify/web-api/issues/374) unless you revoke access, so we will want to save it in an environment variable.

## Using the Spotify API

Finally, we can get some real data! Inside Next.js, create three new values in your `.env.local` file.

```sh
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=
SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN=
```

**Note:** If you've never worked with environment variables in Next.js before, [read this first](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables).

Now we can request an access token using our client ID, client secret, and `refresh_token`.

```js
import querystring from 'querystring';

const client_id = process.env.SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID;
const client_secret = process.env.SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET;
const refresh_token = process.env.SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN;

const basic = Buffer.from(`${client_id}:${client_secret}`).toString('base64');
const TOKEN_ENDPOINT = `https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token`;

const getAccessToken = async () => {
  const response = await fetch(TOKEN_ENDPOINT, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Basic ${basic}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
    },
    body: querystring.stringify({
      grant_type: 'refresh_token',
      refresh_token,
    }),
  });

  return response.json();
};
```

Use this access_token to securely request your favorite songs. This assumes you added the user-top-read permission at the beginning.

```js
const TOP_TRACKS_ENDPOINT = `https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/top/tracks`;

export const getTopTracks = async () => {
  const { access_token } = await getAccessToken();

  return fetch(TOP_TRACKS_ENDPOINT, {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${access_token}`,
    },
  });
};
```

This will return the top ten songs, formatted to remove unnecessary information. Feel free to modify this as you see fit. If everything worked correctly, you should see some data like this after running `next dev`.

```json
{
  "tracks": [
    {
      "artist": "Jamie xx",
      "songUrl": "https://open.spotify.com/track/77Ezu3tBE7gmzQ4mRnZZUf",
      "title": "The Rest Is Noise"
    },
    {
      "artist": "Surfaces",
      "songUrl": "https://open.spotify.com/track/0NjSiGW8b5HYFfjdCbZzbg",
      "title": "Horizons"
    }
  ]
}
```
